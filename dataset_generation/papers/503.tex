\title{Learning to Segment via Cut-and-Paste}

\author{Tal Remez, Jonathan Huang, Matthew Brown}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a weakly-supervised approach to object instance segmentation. Starting with known or predicted object bounding boxes, we learn object masks by playing a game of cut-and-paste in an adversarial learning setup. A mask generator takes a detection box and Faster R-CNN features, and constructs a segmentation mask that is used to cut-and-paste the object into a new image location. The discriminator tries to distinguish between real objects, and those cut and pasted via the generator, giving a learning signal that leads to improved object masks. We verify our method experimentally using Cityscapes, COCO, and aerial image datasets, learning to segment objects without ever having seen a mask in training. Our method exceeds the performance of existing weakly supervised methods \cite{rother2004grabcut,khoreva2016simple}, without requiring hand-tuned segment proposals, and reaches $90\%$ of supervised performance.

\section{Introduction}

Instance segmentation has seen much progress in recent years, with methods such as Mask R-CNN~\cite{he2017mask} now able to generate realistic masks, by building on the success of convolutional object detectors~\cite{ren2015faster,huang2016speed}.
%whose features are re-used to predict masks.%generating realistic masks with modest extra computation on top of an object bounding box detection network.%These methods have built on the success of convolutional object detectors~\cite{ren2015faster,huang2016speed}, whose features are re-used to predict masks
Success has come at the cost of a significant labelling effort; the COCO segmentation dataset~\cite{lin2014microsoft} required around 40 person-years of labelling time for its 80 object categories.  
%\jon{last sentence doesn't fit and not clear what `it` is.}%It also builds on the success of convolutional object detectors~\cite{ren2015faster,huang2016speed}, whose features are re-used to predict masks

Modern object detection datasets have bounding boxes for up to 30k categories~\cite{krishna2017visual}. While still a considerable labelling effort, these bounding boxes can be generated roughly 10 times faster than the per-pixel segmentation masks required for fully supervised instance segmentation training. 
%, and more boxes can be generated once object detectors are trained. 
Moreover, labelling boxes has fixed complexity, whereas pixel-level labelling takes longer for objects with complex boundaries. In the COCO dataset,
for example, some complex object classes, such as `bicycle', are at best approximately labelled (see Figure 15 in~\cite{lin2014microsoft}). This motivates the question we address in this paper (Figure~\ref{figure:cityscapes_example}): can we learn instance
segmentation directly from bounding box data, and without ground truth masks?  We will propose a simple idea, which we call the ``cut-and-paste prior", to solve this problem (see Figure~\ref{fig:teaser2}). 

%% COCO timing stats from paper:%% image category labelling=20000 worker hours% instance spotting=10000 worker hours% instance segmentation=55000 worker hours% (2.5 million object instances, 22 worker hours per 1000 segmentations)%% total = 85000 hours = 42.5 person years% (assume 40hr work week 50 weeks/year)%% instance segmentation step:% 22*3600/1000.0 = 80 seconds per segmentation%%\subsection{Related Work}

We are not the first to address the problem of box-supervised instance or semantic segmentation. Dai et al. propose a box-supervised method that uses an unsupervised candidate mask generator to create regression targets for semantic segmentation~\cite{dai2015boxsup}. The process is then iterated with the learned mask generator. Papandreou et al~\cite{papandreou2015weakly} propose a similar alternation, but using EM to calculate the pixel labels (E-step), and optimise the segmentation network parameters (M-step). ``Simple Does It'' by Khoreva et al.~\cite{khoreva2016simple} also follow Dai et al. in proposing synthetic regression targets. They experiment with using detection boxes alone, as well as Grabcut~\cite{rother2004grabcut} and MCG~\cite{pont2017multiscale} proposal generators, and also extend their approach to instance segmentation (using just 1 iteration in this case). Deepcut~\cite{rajchl2017deepcut} propose a modification to Grabcut using a CNN+CRF model. All of these approaches involve initialization and iteration between label estimation and generator training stages. Pathak et al.~\cite{pathak2015constrained} take a different approach, specifying hand-tuned constraints on the output label space (e.g., 75\% of pixels taking on the true label). Also related is ~\cite{wei2017object}, who grow object segmentation regions by sequentially discovering and erasing discriminative image regions, using classification rather than box supervision.

Our approach is qualitatively different from all these prior approaches. We require no segment proposals, pre-trained boundary detectors, or other hand-tuned initialization/constraints. Neither do we require iteration towards prediction and label consistency. Instead, our priors will be encapsulated in the structure of our generator/discriminator networks, and in our ``cut-and-paste" prior for object segmentation. 
The cut-and-paste prior encapsulates the basic idea that objects can move independently of their background. More precisely, objects may be cut out from one portion of an image, and pasted into another, and still appear realistic (see Figure~\ref{fig:teaser2}). With the help of a discriminator network to judge realism, we can use this process to provide a training signal for an instance segmentation network. 
%See Figure \ref{figure:arch_overview} for an overview of our learning pipeline.

We build on the successful approach of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)~\cite{goodfellow2014generative},
which have proved to be effective in modelling realistic images, e.g., hallucinating faces~\cite{karras2017progressive} and translating between image modalities~\cite{isola2017image}. 
However, rather than trying to generate images, we aim to generate segmentation masks. This allows us to use objective measures of performance (e.g., IoU against ground truth) for evaluation.
%For our purposes, the generator outputs a segmentation mask, and the pasted image is compared to real class exemplars by the discriminator (see Figure \ref{figure:arch_overview}). 
Related to our approach is the work of Luc et al.~\cite{luc2016semantic}, who also use an adversarial network to train a (semantic) segmentation algorithm. However, different to our approach, they use ground truth label maps as input to the discriminator. In our work we assume no such ground truth is available at training time.
%\tal{would it be correct that to say that the generator generates the fake images by cut and paste which is an auxiliary task, we are actually interested in the latent variable which is that mask rather than the final output of a fake image. Is this a common approach is GAN? I seems to remember that most GAN papers are interested in the final fake image rather than some latent variable.}
Also related is the work of Hu et al.~\cite{hu2017learning} who use a partially supervised approach to generate object masks for a very large set of categories. 
They achieve this by joint learning using a set of fully supervised object classes and a larger set of box-only supervised classes, with a transfer function to map between box estimation and mask segmentation parameters. 
This seems to be a promising approach. 
However, in this work we focus on the unsupervised case, with only bounding boxes available for training.

Note that our approach of using cut-and-paste to form a loss function is \emph{not} the same as training data augmentation via cut-and-paste, e.g.,~\cite{dwibedi2017cut}, which takes existing masks and creates more training data out of it. This and related methods~\cite{georgakis2017synthesizing,alhaija2017augmented} do however exploit the same idea that image compositing can be used to create realistic imagery for training. They also note that object placement, lighting etc. are important; we revisit this topic in Sections~\ref{sec:wheretopaste1} and~\ref{sec:wheretopaste2}.
%\mbnote{TODO ref to learned alpha matting (matt)}%\jon{we need a few words summarizing our contributions and that we will show off good results on COCO, cityscales, etc}\subsection{Contributions}

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
\vspace{-1mm}\begin{itemize}%\denselist
\item We propose and formalize 
a new \emph{cut-and-paste} adversarial
training scheme for box-supervised instance segmentation, which captures an intuitive prior, that objects can move independently of their background.  
\vspace{1mm}
\item We discuss the problem of identifying \emph{where} to paste
new objects in an image.
Even though objects are rarely truly independent of their background (e.g., cars do not typically appear in the middle of blue skies or on top of trees), we show that simple randomized
heuristics for selecting pasting locations
are surprisingly effective on real data.
\vspace{1mm}
\item 
Finally we showcase the success and generality of our approach by 
demonstrating that our method effectively learns to segment objects 
on a variety of datasets (street scenes, everyday objects, aerial imagery), without ever having access
to masks as supervision.  We also show
that our training method is stable and
yields models that outperform existing weakly supervised methods, reaching 90\% of supervised model performance.

\section{An Adversarial Formulation of the Cut and Paste Loss}


\section{Experiments}
In this section we present the results of experiments using street scenes (Cityscapes), common objects (COCO) and aerial image datasets. Overall results (Tables \ref{table:cityscapes_results} and \ref{table:coco_results}) indicate that 
%our box-supervised method works across a %variety of domains with minimal changes to methodology.  Specifically, %we demonstrate on the Cityscapes and COCO %datasets as well%as a proprietary Aerial imagery dataset that 
our models are competitive
or better than other weakly supervised baselines.
We also investigate some of the strengths and failure modes of our approach, including analysing dataset specific performance, effect of pasting strategies, settings for loss hyperparameters, and the effect of data scaling.

% We also analyze several of our design choices in detail, including weights for the loss terms and the effect of sampling strategies/artifacts.%on many important classes%and discuss some of the strengths and failure %modes of our approach via%qualitative examples.%Finally, we analyze the effect of several of our design choices %in detail.  %%We show (1) that it is crucial to minimize the effect of any sampling signatures left by our cut-and-paste procedure, (2) that our simple pasting heuristics are surprisingly effective over the naive approach; and (3) that in some cases an additional classification loss is critical for stability.%We show (1) that the additional classification loss $f_{cls}$ is critical for stability, (2) that our simple pasting heuristics are surprisingly effective over the naive approach; and (3) that it is crucial to minimize the effect of any sampling signatures left by our cut-and-paste procedure.\subsection{Evaluation Methodology and Baselines.}\label{section:eval_methodology}%In the Cityscapes and COCO experiments we compared our method to a few baseline methods. %
We compare our proposed approach (which we will refer to in below tables as
{\bf Cut\&Paste}) to a few baseline methods, all of which take as input (1) an image and (2) a bounding box surrounding the
instance to be segmented, and output a segmentation mask.
The simplest baseline strategy (which we call {\bf Box}) is to simply declare 
all pixels within the given ground truth bounding box to be the foreground/object. Since bounding boxes are tight around the objects in the datasets that we use, this is often a reasonable guess, assuming that no additional information is available.
%
Another classic baseline is the {\bf GrabCut}~\cite{rother2004grabcut} algorithm. We use 5 iterations of the OpenCV implementation, guiding with a central foreground rectangle 40\% of the box size if the initial iterations return a zero-mask.
%\tal{We use the OpenCV 2.0 implementation and run it for 5 iterations on each example, it cases where it fails to return a non-zero mask we rerun GrabCut and guide it using a concentric rectangle that is 40\% the size of the object's bounding box in which we set the labels as foreground.} \mbnote{what happens if you just do the 25\% expansion for background?}. % Another classic baseline is the {\bf GrabCut}~\cite{rother2004grabcut} algorithm (we use the OpenCV 2.0 implementation and run it for 5 iterations on each example). %As input, GrabCut receives the entire image and the bounding box surrounding the instance to be segmented, and is run for 5 iterations.%

We also evaluate the performance of the recent {\bf Simple Does It} approach
by Khoreva et al.,~\cite{khoreva2016simple} by running their publicly available pretrained instance segmentation model $DeepLab_{BOX}$, which was trained on PASCAL VOC \cite{pascal-voc-2012} and COCO.

% We also evaluate the performance of the recent {\bf Simple Does It} approach% by Khoreva et al.,~\cite{khoreva2016simple} using their publicly available pretrained instance segmentation model. %As input, this approach takes the entire image and an extra 4-th channel of the same size containing all zeros except for the bounding box which is set to one. The authors describe this as the initial guess for the object mask.%Its lower resolution output is then resized using bicubic interpolation back %to the original image resolution. %
In addition to these baselines, we also train a fully supervised version of our model (called {\bf FullySupervised}), which uses the same architecture as our generator, but is trained using cross entropy loss against ground truth masks. This gives us an idea of the best performance we should expect from our weakly supervised methods.

%which we use%Our models were trained in two forms, the first using our weakly supervised loss and the other a supervised loss. %These supervised models are used to roughly mark the %as the upper bound of performance one can expect from our architectures given access to ground truth masks. For methods outputting low-resolution masks (this includes {\bf Cut\&Paste}, {\bf FullySupervised}, and {\bf Simple Does It}), we resize their masks using bicubic interpolation back to the original image resolution prior to evaluation.
%the low resolution masks were upsampled back to the required resolution using bicubic interpolation.%\mbnote{do we have cut loss and classification loss results for CityScapes and COCO? If not we should say something like: For CityScapes and COCO we use the basic cut+paste loss $\mathcal{L}_{CPGAN}$, for the Aerial dataset, we also experiment with combinations including cut loss $\mathcal{L}_{CGAN}$ and classification loss $\mathcal{L}_{CLS}$}\tal{we mentioned in the text that the detection loss for cityscapes didnt help perfromance as we dont tend to underestimate masks for this dataset.}

In contrast to typical generative models of images based on GANs, we can evaluate our method based on objective measures. We present results in this section in terms of the mean intersection-over-union (\emph{mIoU}) measure,
%\footnote{the mean is taken over all instances in the evaluation/test set.} 
a commonly used metric for segmentation. Since our bounding boxes are assumed to be given, 
%we refrain from presenting average precision/recall based measures such as those used by the COCO dataset as those are primarily based on scores associated with the detected boxes. 
we refrain from presenting average precision/recall based measures such as those used by the COCO dataset since they depend on the detected boxes. 

%In addition mIoU in highly correlated with $L_1$ error rates (or per pixel classification accuracy) therefore only one of them is presented. %\jon{leaving this sentence for now, but it looks quite awkward}\subsection{CityScapes}% MB note cut box for now\begin{table}[tb]

The CityScapes dataset~\cite{Cordts2016Cityscapes} 
consists of densely annotated imagery of
street scenes from cameras mounted on a car. Images are usually wide enough that it is easy to find plausible pasting positions for fake objects, so one would expect our method to perform well on this kind of data.

To prepare the CityScapes data for training our models,
we separate the official training set into a training set and a development set (the latter containing the sequences of Aachen, Bremen and Bochum), using
the official validation set as a test set for all methods. 
We extract instance segmentation masks from the fine-grained annotated ``left-camera'' images for four classes: 
``car'', ``person'', ``traffic-light'' and ``traffic-sign''\footnote{``Traffic-light'' and ``Traffic-sign'' instance segmentation masks are not provided with the dataset, but semantic segmentation masks \emph{are} provided; thus to extract masks, we consider each connected component of these classes as a separate instance.},
removing any
cars or people smaller than 100 pixels along either axis, 
and any traffic lights or signs smaller than 25 pixels. 
Ground truth instance segmentations are used for evaluation, and for training the supervised version of our model. For the box-supervised version, we use a combination of ground truth bounding boxes from the $2,975$ annotated images, and additional bounding boxes generated by running a Faster R-CNN object detector\footnote{The detector is pretrained on the COCO dataset, the model can be found in TensorFlow Object Detection API model zoo:
\url{https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/}}
on the $89,240$ unannotated images in the \texttt{leftImg8bit\_sequence} set.

%For all instances we define the ground truth bounding box as the tightest axis-aligned box that encloses the instance mask. %Note that ground truth instance segmentation masks are only used to evaluate models and train a supervised version of our model, while the box-supervised version only relies on the bounding boxes. %In order to increase the number of bounding boxes with which to train%our model, we generate additional bounding boxes for all four object classes by running a Faster R-CNN object detector~\cite{ren2015faster} which was pretrained on COCO dataset\footnote{The model can be found in TensorFlow Object Detection API model zoo:%\url{https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/}%}, thresholding detection confidences at $90\%$ for cars and people and traffic-lights and $50\%$ for traffic-signs.% We evaluate the weakly supervised method Simple Does It \cite{khoreva2016simple} using a pretreinaed foreground/background segmentation model available online, GrabCut \cite{rother2004grabcut} for which we initialize its iterative process by giving it the image and the bounding box of the object, and a baseline method that predicts the entire bounding box as foreground\footnote{All methods were evaluated on images at resolution $1200\times 600$.}. We additionally compared our weakly supervised model as described in Section \ref{section:eval_methodology} to a supervised version of it. %A numerical analysis of the results is presented in Table \ref{table:cityscapes_results} which shows our approach performs favorably to others on this dataset. 

Our results, shown in Table~\ref{table:cityscapes_results}, demonstrate that
across all four classes, we are consistently better than the {\bf Box}
and  {\bf GrabCut} baselines. Note that {\bf Box} performs suprisingly well on some of these classes, notably signs and traffic lights, for which the ground truth bounding box is typically already a good fit. We also outperform the {\bf Simple Does It} approach and are within 90\% of our fully supervised baseline on all but the ``Car'' class.
Figure \ref{figure:cityscapes_results} shows a qualitative comparison between
masks generated by our method and those by {\bf Simple Does It}. Typically the masks from both methods are comparable in quality, except in the case of people where our {\bf Cut\&Paste} method performs noticeably better, especially in fine details such as arms and legs. 
%We also observe that often our model tends to include the shadow of an object, as can be seen in the vehicle examples in the bottom two row of the same figure.
Figure \ref{figure:cityscapes_results_overlay} presents more examples of our masks.
These results used the $\mathcal{L}_{CPGAN}$ loss, with zero weight to cut and classification loss terms ($w_{cls}=w_{cut}=0$). See Section~\ref{sec:aerial_results} for discussion and results of loss term weightings. All methods were evaluated on images at $600\times 1200$ resolution.

%An interesting phenomenon to note is the tendency of the masks to include the shadows below objects, which are important for realistic synthesis, though not part of the actual object. % this is %discussed further in the limitations section.

Figure \ref{figure:cityscapes_fake_4_categories} shows ``fake images'' created by cut-and-pasting objects using our generated masks.
Generally, the task of generating a realistic composite is well aligned with accurate object segmentation, but there are examples where this is not the case. One such example is the shadows beneath cars, which are important to include in order to synthesize realistic images, but not actually part of the object.

%We divide these examples into two categories depending on whether the generated mask looks correct or incorrect. %Note how hard it is to tell the real image from the fake one when the mask is accurate.%and the random pasting position is logical. %Unfortunately as presented in the examples on the right side of Figure \ref{figure:cityscapes_fake_4_categories} sometimes even when the generated masks are incorrect the resulting image looks fairly realistic.%% Figure \ref{figure:cityscapes_fake_4_categories} shows examples of the % ``fake images'' created by cut-and-pasting objects using our generated masks. % We divide these examples into four categories depending on whether the generated mask looks correct or incorrect and whether the resulting fake image looks realistic or non-realistic. Note how hard it is to tell the real image from the fake one when the mask is accurate and the random pasting position is logical. One can also see a limitation of our technique in the examples for which the mask is accurate but the original object was occluded making it extremely unlikely to pasted randomly in a location that has an appropriate occluder. Presented are also failure cases for which the predicted masks were inaccurate. \jon{revisit paragraph after figure updated}\subsection{Effect of Pasting Strategy}\label{sec:wheretopaste2}

The CityScapes dataset contains object instances at a wide variety of scales corresponding to the wide range of scene depth. For realistic results, it is important to paste objects at the appropriate scale (see Figure \ref{figure:cut_paste_location}). A simple heuristic to achieve this is to paste the object along the same horizontal scanline. We experiment with this approach, shifting with a mean translation of $2\times W$ and standard deviation $W$ (disallowing overlaps), where $W$ is the bounding box width.  This strategy leads to a 4\% absolute increase in per-pixel mask prediction accuracy (from 68\%
to 72\%), when compared to uniformly pasting objects along both the
horizontal and vertical axes. As a sanity check, we also tried pasting Cityscape images into random COCO images for training. This reduced the accuracy to $60\%$ on average and the training process was less stable.

\subsection{Sampling Issues for the Discriminator Network}\label{sec:sampling_issues}
Convolutional networks are highly sensitive to low-level image statistics, and unintended subtle cues may allow them to ``cheat'', rather than solving the intended problem. An example is described in~\cite{doersch2015unsupervised}, where a convnet used chromatic aberration cues to judge image position. We find a similar effect with sampling artifacts in our approach. In particular, we find that pasting with a mask at lower resolution than the source/destination images leads to a significant drop in performance. In our final implementation we perform compositing at the resolution
of the mask. If we instead attempt to composite at $2 \times$ this resolution, we observe that the performance decreases from 71\% to 66\% in terms of per-pixel mask accuracy. We hypothesize that the discriminator picks up on the additional blurring incurred by the lower resolution mask in real vs fake images in this case.
%\mbnote{is this a cityscapes experiment? moved from later in the paper}. 
This suggests that careful image processing is important when dealing with adversarial networks.

Due to the characteristics of this dataset in which images were captured by random cameras and in varied scenes and setups. And due to the relatively small number of training instances (\tal{add some numbers compares to Cityscapes for instance.}). we were expecting our method to significantly under-perform compared to more conventional techniques. % Now we set up the low expectations :o%In addition to CityScapes, we evaluate our approach on the widely used%COCO dataset~\cite{lin2014microsoft}.  COCO consists of images that are%captured by randomly posed cameras in a wide variety of scenes and setups,%both indoors and outdoors.  The dataset also comprises a much larger number of annotated categories compared to CityScapes with most categories appearing fewer than 10000 times throughout.

The COCO dataset~\cite{lin2014microsoft} contains a much wider variety of scene content and geometry than our CityScapes and aerial imagery experiments, and the objects typically occupy a much larger fraction of the image. Whilst these appear to be more difficult conditions for our cut+paste approach, we find that our method still works well. 

%Both of these factors make finding a good location to paste detected objects difficult, however, as we will see our results remain favorable even in this apparently more difficult setting for our method.%so we expected that our method would significantly under-perform compared to state-of-the-art (e.g., {\bf Simple Does It}). %However, as we will see our results remain comparable, if slightly worse, even in this difficult setting for our method.%As such, we initially expected our method to significantly under-perform compared to more conventional techniques, especially given that it is%much harder to find good pasting positions for objects.%Some objects in the COCO dataset are so large within their image that there is very little free space in the same image in which to paste those objects, an issue we address next.%In this experiment we used the data provided by MS-COCO \cite{lin2014microsoft}. We were expecting our method to significantly under-perform compared to more conventional techniques due to the characteristics of this dataset. The first being that images were captured by random cameras and in varied scenes and setups. The second is the relatively small number of training instances (most classes have around $10,000$ instance). And finally it is much harder to find good pasting position for copied object since in some of them are very large leaving very little free space around them, we address this problem next.

Since our method requires an object to be pastable within the same image at a new position, we remove objects that are more than $30\%$ of image width as well as very small objects (less than 14 pixels). This results in removing 36\% of the total number of objects, approximately half of which are too small and half too large.
%\jon{it'd be useful to %know how many instances of each of the 11 categories are left after%this filtering process}\tal{We have a big spreadsheet with this info.}%We also focus in on a collection of 11 classes which are intuitively more likely to look realistic while being pasted in new positions. 
For all instances, we define the ground truth bounding box as the tightest axis-aligned box that encloses the instance mask. We set aside  $15\%$ of the official training set as a development set.

Table \ref{table:coco_results} presents the results for the 10 most common COCO classes, and summary results for all 80 classes. These models were trained using $w_{cls}=w_{cut}=0$.
%%Where the overall mIoU performance on all classes of our fully supervised method was 0.7, for our box-supervised method is 0.64, for Simple Does It 0.62, and for GrabCut 0.47.%
Our method exceeds the performance of {\bf GrabCut} in all cases, and {\bf Simple Does It}~\cite{khoreva2016simple} in 70\% of all COCO classes.
%Although the cut-and-paste prior seems less applicable in COCO vs the more uniform CityScapes dataset, 
We perform particularly well in comparison to [2] on ``baseball bat" (0.43 vs 0.32 mIoU) and ``skis" (0.27 vs 0.23 mIoU). These objects occupy a small fraction of the bounding box, which is problematic for~\cite{khoreva2016simple}, but fine for our method. We perform less well on ``kite" (0.51 vs 0.56 mIoU) and ``airplane" (0.48 vs 0.55). This is perhaps due to the uniform backgrounds that are common for these classes, which will reduce the training signal we see from the cut-and-paste operation (the boundary is arbitrary when pasting with identical backgrounds).
See Figures~\ref{figure:coco_examples} and~\ref{figure:coco_examples_overlay} for examples of masks produced by our method and comparison to those produced by {\bf Simple Does It}.

%We do observe a larger performance gap for some classes such as ``cat'', ``kite'', and ``airplane''. \tal{do we want to add these to the bar-plot even though they aren't in the 20 most common classes? Or ask them to refer to the supp-material?}%We hypothesize this is because some of these classes have larger variations in object appearance and occlusions such as cats, and others like kites and planes usually appear on a uniform background which is a limitation of our method.% Table \ref{table:coco_results} presents the results, comparing% all methods on the 11 selected COCO classes, using $w_{cut}=w_{cls}=0$. % Our first observation is that, % somewhat surprisingly, our method manages to perform comparably % to the {\bf Simple Does It} approach~\cite{khoreva2016simple}. % However we do observe a larger performance gap for the classes ``cat'', ``kite'', and ``airplane''. % We hypothesize this is because some of these classes have larger variations in object appearance and occlusions such as cats, and others like kites and planes usually appear on a uniform background which is a limitation of our method.%Figure~\ref{figure:coco_examples_overlay} shows examples of the masks produced by our method, and Figure~\ref{figure:coco_examples} compares to {\bf Simple Does It}~\cite{khoreva2016simple}. Overall, we are encouraged by the quality of the results, despite the simple pasting scheme. As we saw with CityScapes, it is likely that more complex paste operations could improve results further. %Figure \ref{figure:coco_examples} shows a comparison of a few examples of the masks generated by our method and \cite{khoreva2016simple}. %From these examples one can see the ours masks are comparable in quality to the ones produced by~\cite{khoreva2016simple}. %Figure \ref{figure:coco_examples_overlay} presents more examples of the masks produced by our method; note that some classes such as cats have large variations in appearance compared to others such a giraffes, elephants, or cups. %Overall we are encouraged by our method's performance, despite the simplistic pasting scheme.% Overall we are encouraged by our method's performance on many of our selected COCO classes, despite the simplistic pasting scheme. % Overall we are encouraged our method performs surprisingly well on many of our selected COCO classes, despite the simplistic pasting scheme. %We believe that results can be further improved by using a more sophisticated selection of pasting locations.%We believe a more sophisticated selection of pasting locations can further improve performance.%as discussed in Section \ref{section:limitations_and_future} and finding larger datasets with such common objects.% Our weakly supervised models were trained using a batch size of 4 instances for the generator and 8 instances for the discriminator (4 real and 4 fake), Adam optimizer with learning rate of $5\cdot10^{-5}$, $\beta_1=0.9$, $\beta_2=0.999$, and $\epsilon=10^{-8}$ for $500K$ iterations. Our supervised model was trained using a similar fashion but without the discriminator, the best model on the development set was selected and tested on the final test set.% \begin{table}[h]% \scriptsize% \centering% \begin{tabular}{ | l | C{0.75cm} | C{0.75cm} | C{0.75cm} | C{0.75cm} | C{0.75cm} | C{0.75cm} | C{0.75cm} | C{0.75cm} | C{0.75cm} | C{0.75cm} |  C{0.75cm} |}%   \hline%         Method                                                  & Cat       & Cow    & Elephant & Giraffe   & Horse & Sheep & Zebra & Airplane  & Bird  & Kite  & Cup   \\ \hline%   \multirow{1}{*}{Box}                                          & 0.59      & 0.55   & 0.58     & 0.37      & 0.49  & 0.54  & 0.52  & 0.40      & 0.44  & 0.43  & 0.75  \\ \hline%   \multirow{1}{*}{GrabCut \cite{rother2004grabcut}}             & 0.61      & 0.47   & 0.48     & 0.41      & 0.40  & 0.39  & 0.46  & 0.65      & 0.40  & 0.60  & 0.51  \\ \hline%   \multirow{1}{*}{Simple Does It \cite{khoreva2016simple}}      & 0.78      & 0.63   & 0.66     & 0.55      & 0.58  & 0.63  & 0.63  & 0.55      & 0.55  & 0.56  & 0.72  \\ \hline%   \multirow{1}{*}{Ours w. supervised}                           & 0.72      & 0.63   & 0.65     & 0.51      & 0.56  & 0.60  & 0.62  & 0.48      & 0.54  & 0.51  & 0.78  \\ \hline \hline%   \multirow{1}{*}{Ours supervised}                              & 0.78      & 0.69   & 0.73     & 0.61      & 0.63  & 0.68  & 0.69  & 0.60      & 0.61  & 0.60  & 0.83  \\ \hline% \end{tabular}% \caption{\textbf{COCO mIoU performance.} Presented are mIoU values for 11 COCO classes.}% \label{table:coco_results}% \end{table}\begin{figure}[tb]

effect of dataset size and the additional classification loss $\mathcal{L}_{CLS}$ on performance. Our goal is to segment buildings from their surroundings, using only detection bounding boxes as input, and attempting to ignore occluders such as foliage.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a different setting, we experiment with building segmentation using
a proprietary dataset of aerial images
consisting of $1000\!\times\!1000$ image tiles with annotated building masks. From this dataset, we select a subset of images each of which
contain no
more than 15 houses (in order to allow space in the same image for
pasting), yielding a dataset with 1 million instances.  We also 
similarly generate a validation set containing 
2000 instances. The large size of this dataset also allows us to test performance gains as a function dataset size.   
%Due to the large size of this dataset, we also use%the aerial images to demonstrate that our method is scalable and%improves its performance with more data.% This experiment demonstrates the application of our method to aerial imagery, and shows the effect of dataset size and the additional classification loss $\mathcal{L}_{CLS}$ on performance. Our goal is to segment buildings from their surroundings while ignoring occluders such as foliage, using detection bounding boxes as input.

For these experiments, we trained a Faster R-CNN Inception Resnet v2
(atrous) house detector using the TensorFlow Object Detection API
~\cite{huang2016speed} 
to be used as a backbone for feature extraction.
Since our aerial images are taken at a single scale and
orthorectified, we paste objects into images at locations selected uniformly at random in 
both $x$ and $y$ directions, rejecting pasting locations that 
overlap with other bounding boxes in the image.
%(since pasting a house%directly on top of another house will clearly yield an unrealistic%image).% with a uniform distribution of x,y translation on the input, rejecting any overlapping bounding boxes. %\footnote{The ROI-aligned features used our aerial model are $8\!\times\!8\!\times\!1536$. Since we use bilinear upsampling to upsample the features in our generator the mask prediction head's architecture was left unchanged.\mbnote{??}\tal{is it clearer now?}%\jon{are you saying that the model can be run on any resolution so you didn't have to change this from the Faster R-CNN with Resnet setting>?  If so, I'd just remove this footnote}}. %\subsection{Effect of Dataset Scale}\paragraph{Effect of Dataset Scale.} 
Figure \ref{figure:aerial_plots}(a) shows the effect of data size on the average performance of our models. 
%Since the adversarial training process has a tendency of being noisy, for each data size we trained four models and averaged their performance. % MB note: moved the above to the figure caption
Increasing data size helps the training process, increasing the number of training instances from 5K to 1M reduces the mask prediction error by about $10\%$. 
%\mbnote{why does it level off? have we reached model capacity? should we test this?}\tal{I tried bigger models without success.}%We believe the explanation for this effect lies in the ability of the discriminator to memorize the set of bounding boxes containing ``real'' houses which is limited by the size of the training set. On the other hand the set of bounding boxes containing pasted houses has a virtually limitless number of backgrounds.%In aerial imagery many of the houses are occluded by trees, unlike previous experiments the background at a random pasting location has a non-negligible probability of containing plausible occluders in the form of trees or greenery (see Figure \ref{figure:aerial_overlays} for examples). Therefore, we saw in our experimentation that the generator tends to underestimate the house masks and only copy parts of houses as if they were occluded. The solution we proposed is to add an additional classification loss that promotes the generated bounding box to contain a house. This helped models converge faster and more stably to better performance. %\subsection{Effect of Loss Weightings}%\paragraph{Effect of Cut, Paste and Classification Loss Weightings.} \paragraph{Effect of Loss Weightings.} Figure \ref{figure:aerial_plots}(b) shows the effect of the classification loss weight $w_{cls}$ on the overall performance of the model. 
%We use the same pre-trained classification discriminator $D_{cls}$, and retrain the generator and discriminator using different classification loss weights $w_{cls}$. %For each value of $w_1$ we train five models and we present the average performance\footnote{Error bars represent the standard deviation.}. % MB note moved above to the figure caption
With no classification loss ($w_{cls}=0$) the performance is poor and the model is unstable, as indicated by the error bars. With increasing classification loss, performance improves and the error bars become tighter showing the training process is much more stable. The optimal weight in this case is in the range of $w_{cls}\in[1,4]$.  When conducting a similar experiment for the Cityscapes dataset we found that the classification weight increases stability but does not improve performance overall.
This may be due to the high incidence of occlusion in our aerial image data, e.g., a subsection of a mask often resembles a building occluded by trees. Figure \ref{figure:aerial_overlays} shows a few examples of typical aerial images and the segmentation masks our method produces when trained using $w_{cls}=1$. 

We also experimented with various weightings of cut loss $w_{cut}$, but found this did not work as well as our classification loss.
%This gave a small improvement of \mbnote{TODO} but did not help as much as classification loss. 
We note that while cut loss serves to expand masks that are too small, once the mask is larger than the object the cut loss provides no useful signal. 

%We hypothesize this is due to the fact that in Aerial imagery unlike Cityscapes pasting small fractions of objects will usually result in a realistic looking fake image. \begin{figure}[tb]

A few failure cases of our method are presented in Figure \ref{figure:coco_failures}. For the Giraffe and Kite examples, the mask is overestimated, but the non-unique backgrounds lead to convincing fake images. Note that the shadow of the Giraffe is copied in the first case, another common failure mode.
Other examples include missing or added parts, such as the missing head and extra ``skirt" connecting the legs for the people towards the right of the figure. Next to these is an interesting example with a person carrying a suitcase. The generator decides it would be more realistic to change this to legs in this example, presumably because suitcases are a rare occurrence in the training set. 
%We see that our method sometimes finds%it difficult to handle thin structures such as legs.  Another typical failure%happens in the case of extreme occlusions such as that of the zebra image in %Figure~\ref{figure:coco_failures}, in which there is ambiguity as to which object we are asking our network to produce a segment for.  %In one of the examples the mask of the person is missing its head, another example shows a case in which the generator connects the legs of the person in a ``skirt''-like shape. An interesting failure case can be seen in the rightmost image, where the generator ``crafts'' legs for a person out of the red bag he is holding in the original image. 
Note that the ``fake" images are often still realistic in many of these cases.

And if the%discriminator's job is too easy, then the generator will not need%to learn the generate more realistic masks.%The question of where to paste objects in an image in order for them look as realistic as %possible is consequently a fundamental one. %In this work we choose to rely on %simple and intuitive heuristics to select new locations for%pasting objects, but we believe that%incorporating the selection of good paste locations into the learning process is an interesting %issue to tackle for future work.%In the following we discuss two types of heuristics that we%consider.%Nonetheless, care must be taken while selecting the paste location otherwise the task of discriminating real from fake objects can boil down to classifying the background. This could prevent the discriminator from focusing on the underling task and make it impossible for the generator to fool the discriminator no matter how realistic the masks it generates. For example trying to paste cars that are usually located on a road into a sky background creates fake examples that are easily distinguishable from real ones just by looking at the background color.%\jon{perhaps move these paragraphs to the experiments?}%\mbnote{DONE}%For aerial imagery, we observe that all parts %of a given scene are%equidistant from the camera (i.e. %there are few scale changes across%different image regions) and all image areas have%the similar likelihood of containing valid looking%backgrounds.  Thus our heuristic is simply to perform%uniform selection in both the horizontal and vertical axes while disallowing paste locations from overlapping other annotated%objects in the same image.  We find this uniform selection %heuristic is simple and effective, allowing for maximum diversity%in paste locations.% MB note moved to aerial imagery section%For street images which are captured from a %driving car (e.g.%from the Cityscapes dataset)%our heuristic is %to paste objects along the same horizontal %scanline. %This simple%strategy makes it unlikely that we would paste %objects of%interest (such as people or cars) into %unrealistic background%(e.g. trees or sky). Furthermore, in order to promote locations in which the object has the correct scale with respect to the background we always paste an object into a random position constrained to not be too far from its original position. More specifically, we shift the object by a random amount according to a Gaussian distribution whose mean is twice the width of the bounding box and standard deviation is equal to the width of the bounding box. We also randomly choose (with $50\%$ probability) whether to paste to the left or the right of the original object location and disallow locations that overlap with the original object. %%Compared to uniformly pasting objects along both the%horizontal and vertical axes (see Figure \ref{figure:cut_paste_location}), our experiments show that the same-scanline pasting strategy as described above leads to a 4\%%absolute increase in per-pixel mask prediction accuracy (from 68\%%to 72\% on Cityscapes).  Interestingly, we find that%the same strategy is effective on the COCO dataset, which%contains photographs of everyday scenes, even though%images in this dataset%are not constrained to be taken from any particular%height or angle.%\subsection{Sampling Issues for the Discriminator Network}%We found our discriminator network highly sensitive to any sampling signatures left by our cut and paste process. For example, any blurring or aliasing in the masked images allowed the discriminator to spot our fakes easily and with very high confidence. Of course, this ``cheating" method found by the discriminator did not help the generator to produce better masks, so we took steps to minimise any sampling artifacts in our pasted imagery. %\mbnote{TODO: synthesise the analysis of this below, with some approximate numbers for performance} %\tal{I have added some number and descriptions and am still waiting for one experiment.}%We found that care should be taken when designing the task presented to our method. Ideally the discriminator should focus on high level semantic information such as entire objects such as cars and people, and missing object parts such as arms and legs or wheels. In our experimentation we found that the discriminator was very good at finding "trivial" shortcuts to distinguish the real objects from pasted ones. The main problem arising form such "trivial" solutions is that the gradients reaching the generator don't promote the solutions we wish to encourage, the can even created an extremely unbalanced "playground" where there is no possible way for the generator to fool the discriminator no matter what mask it generates. We traced the root of the problem to image processing artifacts left behind during the copy pasting process. The more image processing steps we used the easier the task became for the discriminator and the worse the resulting generated masks were. In other words, the more image processing steps it takes to generate the "fake" image patches the easier it becomes to separate them from the "real" ones using low level image statistics which conv-nets are excellent at finding.%We experimented with multiple pasting options at different image resolutions, the first was to upsample the generators masks to the original resolution of the object and cutting and pasting at full resolution. A different approach we tested was to cut and paste at a lower resolution.%, we found that the best results were achieved when the cutting and pasting happens at the resolution presented to the discriminator and that pasting at a very high resolution makes the problem too easy for the discriminator resulting in an erratic behaviour of the generator. In other words, %We found it is best if images are downsampled to the final resolution used for the discriminator and then the object is cut and pasted using the mask. Note that the mask produced by the network might be in a different resolution and must be resized appropriately. Our experimentation showed that it is best to set the mask resolution equal to the resolution at which the cut and paste is done  (71\% vs 66\% per pixel mask accuracy between working at the mask's resolution versus $2\times$ that resolution). This approach means that the ``real" and ``fake" image patches undergo a process which is as similar as possible to one another and no processing steps are performed on the mask. In addition we found that anti-aliasing the images by slightly blurring them before down-sampling also promotes better solutions (increases mask per-pixel accuracy by as much as 3\% in some experiments). %In summary cutting and pasting at the resolution presented to the discriminator using a mask at that same resolution outperformed other combination. % % CUTTING THE COPY PASTE ARTIFACTS FIGURE FOR NOW%%\input{copy_paste_artifacts_figure.tex}% \tal{Do we want to show why we chose a mask resolution of 28x28?}%\subsection{Other Failure Modes}% MB moved to discussion/conclusions

\section{Conclusions}
We have presented a new approach to instance segmentation that uses a simple property of objects, namely that they are ``cut-and-pastable", coupled with a generative adversarial network to learn object masks. Our method exceeds the performance of existing box-supervised methods on the CityScapes and COCO datasets, with no mask ground truth and without the need for pre-trained segment or boundary detectors.

%Whilst being able to move independently is an enormous simplification of what constitutes an object, our intriguing finding is that this alone provides enough of a constraint to effectively learn object segmentation masks.  

We have shown that intelligent object placement in the paste step can significantly improve mask estimation. This suggests an interesting direction for future work, where the compositing step is also data-dependent. For example, object placement, colour and illumination could depend on the destination image. Related work shows this works well for data augmentation~\cite{dwibedi2017cut,georgakis2017synthesizing,alhaija2017augmented}. 

More generally, and as in work such as~\cite{tung2017adversarial}, we could envisage a range of settings where vision+graphics imitate photography, with adversarial losses to jointly optimise image understanding and rendering stages. Such methods could open up the possibility of performing detailed visual perception with reduced dependence on large-scale supervised datasets.

%Clearly more complex pasting strategies would be possible, e.g., in the manner of, this would be a good area for future work.%\jon{\cite{knobel2002cut} doesn't seem relevant...}\mbnote{fixed}%As noted earlier, textureless backgrounds pose a problem for our approach. These encourage the generator to systematically over-estimate the object, since any mask which contains the object of interest will appear realistic when pasted on a similar background.%\mbnote{TODO: ideas to deal with this issue?}. %Another feature of our approach is that scene elements that appear systematically with the object of interest (e.g., shadows underneath cars) are difficult to distinguish from that object, and in fact are normally preferred to be included in the segmentation mask. Pasting a car into a bright scene without a shadow would be unrealistic, %for example (See Figure \ref{figure:cityscapes_fake_4_categories}).%Some of our method's limitation are due to its limited ability to handle data which includes very crowded images leaving no place to paste objects into, or data in which objects are very occluded making it hard to paste them in locations that will have a believable occluder, or objects that appear on uniform background (such as kites or planes). In addition some objects have a very strong semantic connection to other objects making it hard to separate them without better placement techniques for the pasted objects (for instance eye-glasses, hats or shirts which almost always appear on a person). Another limitation is the requirement of having a very large dataset, in COCO most classes have about 10K instances compared to more that 100K in Cityscapes. %We think that future work should research how to incorporate the positioning of fake objects into the learning process. While being an interesting topic on its own we believe this might also improve segmentation performance.
