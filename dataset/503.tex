\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a weakly-supervised approach to object instance segmentation. Starting with known or predicted object bounding boxes, we learn object masks by playing a game of cut-and-paste in an adversarial learning setup. A mask generator takes a detection box and Faster R-CNN features, and constructs a segmentation mask that is used to cut-and-paste the object into a new image location. The discriminator tries to distinguish between real objects, and those cut and pasted via the generator, giving a learning signal that leads to improved object masks. We verify our method experimentally using Cityscapes, COCO, and aerial image datasets, learning to segment objects without ever having seen a mask in training. Our method exceeds the performance of existing weakly supervised methods \cite{rother2004grabcut,khoreva2016simple}, without requiring hand-tuned segment proposals, and reaches $90\%$ of supervised performance.

\section{Introduction}

Instance segmentation has seen much progress in recent years, with methods such as Mask R-CNN~\cite{he2017mask} now able to generate realistic masks, by building on the success of convolutional object detectors~\cite{ren2015faster,huang2016speed}.
Success has come at the cost of a significant labelling effort; the COCO segmentation dataset~\cite{lin2014microsoft} required around 40 person-years of labelling time for its 80 object categories.  

Modern object detection datasets have bounding boxes for up to 30k categories~\cite{krishna2017visual}. While still a considerable labelling effort, these bounding boxes can be generated roughly 10 times faster than the per-pixel segmentation masks required for fully supervised instance segmentation training. 
Moreover, labelling boxes has fixed complexity, whereas pixel-level labelling takes longer for objects with complex boundaries. In the COCO dataset,
for example, some complex object classes, such as `bicycle', are at best approximately labelled (see Figure 15 in~\cite{lin2014microsoft}). This motivates the question we address in this paper (Figure~\ref{figure:cityscapes_example}): can we learn instance
segmentation directly from bounding box data, and without ground truth masks?  We will propose a simple idea, which we call the ``cut-and-paste prior", to solve this problem (see Figure~\ref{fig:teaser2}). 


We are not the first to address the problem of box-supervised instance or semantic segmentation. Dai et al. propose a box-supervised method that uses an unsupervised candidate mask generator to create regression targets for semantic segmentation~\cite{dai2015boxsup}. The process is then iterated with the learned mask generator. Papandreou et al~\cite{papandreou2015weakly} propose a similar alternation, but using EM to calculate the pixel labels (E-step), and optimise the segmentation network parameters (M-step). ``Simple Does It'' by Khoreva et al.~\cite{khoreva2016simple} also follow Dai et al. in proposing synthetic regression targets. They experiment with using detection boxes alone, as well as Grabcut~\cite{rother2004grabcut} and MCG~\cite{pont2017multiscale} proposal generators, and also extend their approach to instance segmentation (using just 1 iteration in this case). Deepcut~\cite{rajchl2017deepcut} propose a modification to Grabcut using a CNN+CRF model. All of these approaches involve initialization and iteration between label estimation and generator training stages. Pathak et al.~\cite{pathak2015constrained} take a different approach, specifying hand-tuned constraints on the output label space (e.g., 75\% of pixels taking on the true label). Also related is ~\cite{wei2017object}, who grow object segmentation regions by sequentially discovering and erasing discriminative image regions, using classification rather than box supervision.

Our approach is qualitatively different from all these prior approaches. We require no segment proposals, pre-trained boundary detectors, or other hand-tuned initialization/constraints. Neither do we require iteration towards prediction and label consistency. Instead, our priors will be encapsulated in the structure of our generator/discriminator networks, and in our ``cut-and-paste" prior for object segmentation. 
The cut-and-paste prior encapsulates the basic idea that objects can move independently of their background. More precisely, objects may be cut out from one portion of an image, and pasted into another, and still appear realistic (see Figure~\ref{fig:teaser2}). With the help of a discriminator network to judge realism, we can use this process to provide a training signal for an instance segmentation network. 

We build on the successful approach of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)~\cite{goodfellow2014generative},
which have proved to be effective in modelling realistic images, e.g., hallucinating faces~\cite{karras2017progressive} and translating between image modalities~\cite{isola2017image}. 
However, rather than trying to generate images, we aim to generate segmentation masks. This allows us to use objective measures of performance (e.g., IoU against ground truth) for evaluation.
Related to our approach is the work of Luc et al.~\cite{luc2016semantic}, who also use an adversarial network to train a (semantic) segmentation algorithm. However, different to our approach, they use ground truth label maps as input to the discriminator. In our work we assume no such ground truth is available at training time.
Also related is the work of Hu et al.~\cite{hu2017learning} who use a partially supervised approach to generate object masks for a very large set of categories. 
They achieve this by joint learning using a set of fully supervised object classes and a larger set of box-only supervised classes, with a transfer function to map between box estimation and mask segmentation parameters. 
This seems to be a promising approach. 
However, in this work we focus on the unsupervised case, with only bounding boxes available for training.

Note that our approach of using cut-and-paste to form a loss function is \emph{not} the same as training data augmentation via cut-and-paste, e.g.,~\cite{dwibedi2017cut}, which takes existing masks and creates more training data out of it. This and related methods~\cite{georgakis2017synthesizing,alhaija2017augmented} do however exploit the same idea that image compositing can be used to create realistic imagery for training. They also note that object placement, lighting etc. are important; we revisit this topic in Sections~\ref{sec:wheretopaste1} and~\ref{sec:wheretopaste2}.

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
\vspace{-1mm}\begin{itemize}%\denselist
\item We propose and formalize 
a new \emph{cut-and-paste} adversarial
training scheme for box-supervised instance segmentation, which captures an intuitive prior, that objects can move independently of their background.  
\vspace{1mm}
\item We discuss the problem of identifying \emph{where} to paste
new objects in an image.
Even though objects are rarely truly independent of their background (e.g., cars do not typically appear in the middle of blue skies or on top of trees), we show that simple randomized
heuristics for selecting pasting locations
are surprisingly effective on real data.
\vspace{1mm}
\item 
Finally we showcase the success and generality of our approach by 
demonstrating that our method effectively learns to segment objects 
on a variety of datasets (street scenes, everyday objects, aerial imagery), without ever having access
to masks as supervision.  We also show
that our training method is stable and
yields models that outperform existing weakly supervised methods, reaching 90\% of supervised model performance.

\section{An Adversarial Formulation of the Cut and Paste Loss}


\section{Experiments}
In this section we present the results of experiments using street scenes (Cityscapes), common objects (COCO) and aerial image datasets. Overall results (Tables \ref{table:cityscapes_results} and \ref{table:coco_results}) indicate that 
our models are competitive
or better than other weakly supervised baselines.
We also investigate some of the strengths and failure modes of our approach, including analysing dataset specific performance, effect of pasting strategies, settings for loss hyperparameters, and the effect of data scaling.

We compare our proposed approach (which we will refer to in below tables as
{\bf Cut\&Paste}) to a few baseline methods, all of which take as input (1) an image and (2) a bounding box surrounding the
instance to be segmented, and output a segmentation mask.
The simplest baseline strategy (which we call {\bf Box}) is to simply declare 
all pixels within the given ground truth bounding box to be the foreground/object. Since bounding boxes are tight around the objects in the datasets that we use, this is often a reasonable guess, assuming that no additional information is available.
Another classic baseline is the {\bf GrabCut}~\cite{rother2004grabcut} algorithm. We use 5 iterations of the OpenCV implementation, guiding with a central foreground rectangle 40\% of the box size if the initial iterations return a zero-mask.

We also evaluate the performance of the recent {\bf Simple Does It} approach
by Khoreva et al.,~\cite{khoreva2016simple} by running their publicly available pretrained instance segmentation model $DeepLab_{BOX}$, which was trained on PASCAL VOC \cite{pascal-voc-2012} and COCO.

In addition to these baselines, we also train a fully supervised version of our model (called {\bf FullySupervised}), which uses the same architecture as our generator, but is trained using cross entropy loss against ground truth masks. This gives us an idea of the best performance we should expect from our weakly supervised methods.


In contrast to typical generative models of images based on GANs, we can evaluate our method based on objective measures. We present results in this section in terms of the mean intersection-over-union (\emph{mIoU}) measure,
a commonly used metric for segmentation. Since our bounding boxes are assumed to be given, 
we refrain from presenting average precision/recall based measures such as those used by the COCO dataset since they depend on the detected boxes.

The CityScapes dataset~\cite{Cordts2016Cityscapes} 
consists of densely annotated imagery of
street scenes from cameras mounted on a car. Images are usually wide enough that it is easy to find plausible pasting positions for fake objects, so one would expect our method to perform well on this kind of data.

To prepare the CityScapes data for training our models,
we separate the official training set into a training set and a development set (the latter containing the sequences of Aachen, Bremen and Bochum), using
the official validation set as a test set for all methods. 
We extract instance segmentation masks from the fine-grained annotated ``left-camera'' images for four classes: 
``car'', ``person'', ``traffic-light'' and ``traffic-sign''\footnote{``Traffic-light'' and ``Traffic-sign'' instance segmentation masks are not provided with the dataset, but semantic segmentation masks \emph{are} provided; thus to extract masks, we consider each connected component of these classes as a separate instance.},
removing any
cars or people smaller than 100 pixels along either axis, 
and any traffic lights or signs smaller than 25 pixels. 
Ground truth instance segmentations are used for evaluation, and for training the supervised version of our model. For the box-supervised version, we use a combination of ground truth bounding boxes from the $2,975$ annotated images, and additional bounding boxes generated by running a Faster R-CNN object detector\footnote{The detector is pretrained on the COCO dataset, the model can be found in TensorFlow Object Detection API model zoo:
\url{https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/}}
on the $89,240$ unannotated images in the \texttt{leftImg8bit\_sequence} set.


Our results, shown in Table~\ref{table:cityscapes_results}, demonstrate that
across all four classes, we are consistently better than the {\bf Box}
and  {\bf GrabCut} baselines. Note that {\bf Box} performs suprisingly well on some of these classes, notably signs and traffic lights, for which the ground truth bounding box is typically already a good fit. We also outperform the {\bf Simple Does It} approach and are within 90\% of our fully supervised baseline on all but the ``Car'' class.
Figure \ref{figure:cityscapes_results} shows a qualitative comparison between
masks generated by our method and those by {\bf Simple Does It}. Typically the masks from both methods are comparable in quality, except in the case of people where our {\bf Cut\&Paste} method performs noticeably better, especially in fine details such as arms and legs. 
Figure \ref{figure:cityscapes_results_overlay} presents more examples of our masks.
These results used the $\mathcal{L}_{CPGAN}$ loss, with zero weight to cut and classification loss terms ($w_{cls}=w_{cut}=0$). See Section~\ref{sec:aerial_results} for discussion and results of loss term weightings. All methods were evaluated on images at $600\times 1200$ resolution.


Figure \ref{figure:cityscapes_fake_4_categories} shows ``fake images'' created by cut-and-pasting objects using our generated masks.
Generally, the task of generating a realistic composite is well aligned with accurate object segmentation, but there are examples where this is not the case. One such example is the shadows beneath cars, which are important to include in order to synthesize realistic images, but not actually part of the object.


The CityScapes dataset contains object instances at a wide variety of scales corresponding to the wide range of scene depth. For realistic results, it is important to paste objects at the appropriate scale (see Figure \ref{figure:cut_paste_location}). A simple heuristic to achieve this is to paste the object along the same horizontal scanline. We experiment with this approach, shifting with a mean translation of $2\times W$ and standard deviation $W$ (disallowing overlaps), where $W$ is the bounding box width.  This strategy leads to a 4\% absolute increase in per-pixel mask prediction accuracy (from 68\%
to 72\%), when compared to uniformly pasting objects along both the
horizontal and vertical axes. As a sanity check, we also tried pasting Cityscape images into random COCO images for training. This reduced the accuracy to $60\%$ on average and the training process was less stable.

\subsection{Sampling Issues for the Discriminator Network}\label{sec:sampling_issues}
Convolutional networks are highly sensitive to low-level image statistics, and unintended subtle cues may allow them to ``cheat'', rather than solving the intended problem. An example is described in~\cite{doersch2015unsupervised}, where a convnet used chromatic aberration cues to judge image position. We find a similar effect with sampling artifacts in our approach. In particular, we find that pasting with a mask at lower resolution than the source/destination images leads to a significant drop in performance. In our final implementation we perform compositing at the resolution
of the mask. If we instead attempt to composite at $2 \times$ this resolution, we observe that the performance decreases from 71\% to 66\% in terms of per-pixel mask accuracy. We hypothesize that the discriminator picks up on the additional blurring incurred by the lower resolution mask in real vs fake images in this case.
This suggests that careful image processing is important when dealing with adversarial networks.

Due to the characteristics of this dataset in which images were captured by random cameras and in varied scenes and setups. And due to the relatively small number of training instances (\tal{add some numbers compares to Cityscapes for instance.}). we were expecting our method to significantly under-perform compared to more conventional techniques. % Now we set up the low expectations :o%In addition to CityScapes, we evaluate our approach on the widely used%COCO dataset~\cite{lin2014microsoft}.  COCO consists of images that are%captured by randomly posed cameras in a wide variety of scenes and setups,%both indoors and outdoors.  The dataset also comprises a much larger number of annotated categories compared to CityScapes with most categories appearing fewer than 10000 times throughout.

The COCO dataset~\cite{lin2014microsoft} contains a much wider variety of scene content and geometry than our CityScapes and aerial imagery experiments, and the objects typically occupy a much larger fraction of the image. Whilst these appear to be more difficult conditions for our cut+paste approach, we find that our method still works well. 


Since our method requires an object to be pastable within the same image at a new position, we remove objects that are more than $30\%$ of image width as well as very small objects (less than 14 pixels). This results in removing 36\% of the total number of objects, approximately half of which are too small and half too large.
For all instances, we define the ground truth bounding box as the tightest axis-aligned box that encloses the instance mask. We set aside  $15\%$ of the official training set as a development set.

Table \ref{table:coco_results} presents the results for the 10 most common COCO classes, and summary results for all 80 classes. These models were trained using $w_{cls}=w_{cut}=0$.
Our method exceeds the performance of {\bf GrabCut} in all cases, and {\bf Simple Does It}~\cite{khoreva2016simple} in 70\% of all COCO classes.
We perform particularly well in comparison to [2] on ``baseball bat" (0.43 vs 0.32 mIoU) and ``skis" (0.27 vs 0.23 mIoU). These objects occupy a small fraction of the bounding box, which is problematic for~\cite{khoreva2016simple}, but fine for our method. We perform less well on ``kite" (0.51 vs 0.56 mIoU) and ``airplane" (0.48 vs 0.55). This is perhaps due to the uniform backgrounds that are common for these classes, which will reduce the training signal we see from the cut-and-paste operation (the boundary is arbitrary when pasting with identical backgrounds).
See Figures~\ref{figure:coco_examples} and~\ref{figure:coco_examples_overlay} for examples of masks produced by our method and comparison to those produced by {\bf Simple Does It}.

effect of dataset size and the additional classification loss $\mathcal{L}_{CLS}$ on performance. Our goal is to segment buildings from their surroundings, using only detection bounding boxes as input, and attempting to ignore occluders such as foliage.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a different setting, we experiment with building segmentation using
a proprietary dataset of aerial images
consisting of $1000\!\times\!1000$ image tiles with annotated building masks. From this dataset, we select a subset of images each of which
contain no
more than 15 houses (in order to allow space in the same image for
pasting), yielding a dataset with 1 million instances.  We also 
similarly generate a validation set containing 
2000 instances. The large size of this dataset also allows us to test performance gains as a function dataset size.   

For these experiments, we trained a Faster R-CNN Inception Resnet v2
(atrous) house detector using the TensorFlow Object Detection API
~\cite{huang2016speed} 
to be used as a backbone for feature extraction.
Since our aerial images are taken at a single scale and
orthorectified, we paste objects into images at locations selected uniformly at random in 
both $x$ and $y$ directions, rejecting pasting locations that 
overlap with other bounding boxes in the image.
Figure \ref{figure:aerial_plots}(a) shows the effect of data size on the average performance of our models. 
Increasing data size helps the training process, increasing the number of training instances from 5K to 1M reduces the mask prediction error by about $10\%$. 
With no classification loss ($w_{cls}=0$) the performance is poor and the model is unstable, as indicated by the error bars. With increasing classification loss, performance improves and the error bars become tighter showing the training process is much more stable. The optimal weight in this case is in the range of $w_{cls}\in[1,4]$.  When conducting a similar experiment for the Cityscapes dataset we found that the classification weight increases stability but does not improve performance overall.
This may be due to the high incidence of occlusion in our aerial image data, e.g., a subsection of a mask often resembles a building occluded by trees. Figure \ref{figure:aerial_overlays} shows a few examples of typical aerial images and the segmentation masks our method produces when trained using $w_{cls}=1$. 

We also experimented with various weightings of cut loss $w_{cut}$, but found this did not work as well as our classification loss.
We note that while cut loss serves to expand masks that are too small, once the mask is larger than the object the cut loss provides no useful signal.

A few failure cases of our method are presented in Figure \ref{figure:coco_failures}. For the Giraffe and Kite examples, the mask is overestimated, but the non-unique backgrounds lead to convincing fake images. Note that the shadow of the Giraffe is copied in the first case, another common failure mode.
Other examples include missing or added parts, such as the missing head and extra ``skirt" connecting the legs for the people towards the right of the figure. Next to these is an interesting example with a person carrying a suitcase. The generator decides it would be more realistic to change this to legs in this example, presumably because suitcases are a rare occurrence in the training set. 
Note that the ``fake" images are often still realistic in many of these cases.


\section{Conclusions}
We have presented a new approach to instance segmentation that uses a simple property of objects, namely that they are ``cut-and-pastable", coupled with a generative adversarial network to learn object masks. Our method exceeds the performance of existing box-supervised methods on the CityScapes and COCO datasets, with no mask ground truth and without the need for pre-trained segment or boundary detectors.


We have shown that intelligent object placement in the paste step can significantly improve mask estimation. This suggests an interesting direction for future work, where the compositing step is also data-dependent. For example, object placement, colour and illumination could depend on the destination image. Related work shows this works well for data augmentation~\cite{dwibedi2017cut,georgakis2017synthesizing,alhaija2017augmented}. 

More generally, and as in work such as~\cite{tung2017adversarial}, we could envisage a range of settings where vision+graphics imitate photography, with adversarial losses to jointly optimise image understanding and rendering stages. Such methods could open up the possibility of performing detailed visual perception with reduced dependence on large-scale supervised datasets.
